# Projectile Motion Simulator

## Description
This web-based tool simulates and visualizes the trajectory of a projectile based on user inputs like initial velocity, launch angle, and gravitational acceleration.

## Features
- Input parameters: initial velocity, angle, and gravity.
- Outputs key metrics: time of flight, maximum height, and range.
- Visualizes the trajectory on a 2D canvas.

## Usage
1. Open the HTML file in your browser.
2. Enter the desired values for initial velocity, launch angle, and gravity.
3. Click "Simulate" to see the trajectory and outputs.

## Files
- `index.html`: Main structure of the application.
- `main.js`: Logic for calculations and visualization.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Future Enhancements
- Include air resistance effects.
- Add sliders for real-time adjustments.
